A language server for Los Alamos' [Monte Carlo N-Particle (MCNP)](https://mcnp.lanl.gov/) Transport Code. The language server provides helpful feedback for developing MCNP input files. The features are intended to provide an IDE typical for more standard languages (i.e. Python, C++, etc.).

The project currently has client support for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
